# Guess My Number Simple Game

I'm excited to share my simple "Guess My Number" game! While the game itself is fun, the real focus for me was on the JavaScript solutions I implemented and the design I created. My goal was to use Vanilla JavaScript to make everything work, and I'm really happy with how it turned out.

Of course, I'll continue to improve the code and add new features in the future. Thank you so much for checking out my first game built with JavaScript — I’d love to hear your feedback!
